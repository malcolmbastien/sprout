# 🎨 Callouts and Special Formatting

Sprout includes a rich callout system inspired by GitHub alerts and Obsidian callouts. These help highlight important information and add visual interest to your posts.

## GitHub-Style Alerts

### Notes
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout. Use it for general information that readers should be aware of.

### Tips
> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout. Perfect for sharing helpful advice or best practices.

### Important Information
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important callout. Use it when you need to emphasize critical information.

### Warnings
> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues or dangers.

### Caution
> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution callout. Similar to warnings but for less critical situations.

## Garden-Specific Callouts

### Ideas
> [!IDEA]
> This is an idea callout. Perfect for brainstorming and sharing creative thoughts.

### Questions
> [!QUESTION]
> This is a question callout. Use it to pose questions that encourage reader engagement.

### Draft Content
> [!DRAFT]
> This is a draft callout. Use it to mark sections that are still being developed.

## Advanced Callouts

### Multi-line Callouts

> [!TIP]
> Callouts can span multiple lines
> and include **formatting** like *italics*, `code`, and [links](https://example.com).
>
> They can even include:
> - Lists
> - Multiple paragraphs
> - Any markdown formatting

### Nested Content

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can include code blocks in callouts:
>
> ```javascript
> console.log("Hello from a callout!");
> ```
>
> And even other elements like quotes:
> > This is a nested quote inside a callout

## Callout Best Practices

- **Use sparingly** - Too many callouts can overwhelm readers
- **Choose appropriate types** - Different callouts serve different purposes
- **Keep them concise** - Long callouts lose their impact
- **Test readability** - Make sure callouts enhance, not distract from, your content
