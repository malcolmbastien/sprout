# 🏗️ Draft Post Example

This post demonstrates the draft functionality in Sprout. When you set `draft: true` in your frontmatter, the post will display a prominent "Draft Content" banner at the top.

## What Drafts Are For

Draft posts are perfect for:

- **Work in progress** - Ideas you're still developing
- **Private thoughts** - Content not ready for public consumption
- **Testing features** - Trying out new formatting or components
- **Incremental publishing** - Building up posts over time

## Draft Banner Features

The draft banner includes:
- A construction emoji (🏗️)
- Clear "Draft Content" heading
- Explanatory text about the content being work in progress
- Distinctive amber/orange styling to match the "updated" theme

## When to Use Drafts

Consider using drafts when:

> [!DRAFT]
> This content is still being developed. The ideas here are preliminary and may change significantly.

1. **Early ideation** - When you're just starting to explore a topic
2. **Complex topics** - When you need time to research and organize thoughts
3. **Collaborative work** - When gathering feedback before publishing
4. **Series planning** - When outlining future posts in a series

## Publishing Drafts

When you're ready to publish:
1. Remove `draft: true` from the frontmatter
2. Update the `status` from "seed" to "sprout" or "tree" as appropriate
3. Consider updating the `publishedDate` if desired
4. The draft banner will automatically disappear

> [!TIP]
> Draft posts are still processed and indexed, but the banner clearly indicates their status to readers.

This draft post serves as both documentation and a template for your own draft content! 🌱
