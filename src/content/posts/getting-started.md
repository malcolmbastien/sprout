# 🌱 Getting Started with Your Digital Garden

Welcome to your new digital garden! This post demonstrates the basic features and formatting options available in Sprout.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a space for cultivating your thoughts and ideas over time. Unlike traditional blogs, gardens:

- **Grow organically** - Posts evolve from seeds to sprouts to trees
- **Track evolution** - See how your thoughts develop over time
- **Encourage exploration** - Discover connections between ideas

## Basic Formatting

### Headers
Use different header levels to organize your content:

# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section Headers
### H3 - Subsection Headers
#### H4 - Smaller Sections

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks
- ~~Strikethrough~~ using double tildes
- `Inline code` using backticks

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Item three

#### Ordered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Links and Images

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function helloGarden() {
  console.log("Welcome to your digital garden!");
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Customize the theme colors in `src/lib/theme.ts`
2. Update the site configuration in `astro.config.mjs`
3. Start writing your first real post
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages or your preferred hosting
